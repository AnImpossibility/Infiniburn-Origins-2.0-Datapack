This is a set of origins I have created for my private minecraft server, the Infiniburn SMP.

**The power list and origin details are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cupW6kQP5y_U-yMkKsHH0bUaIhNRJYYM0-jj9jNnGhE/edit).** Clicking on a power gives you its description and any badges. You have the ability to comment on this spreadsheet if you want to give any feedback.

As described at the bottom of the spreadsheet, I'm using five different factors in analyzing an origin. Origins should fulfill all of them:
1. Not obviously better or worse than another origin,
2. Has abilities that compel players to pick the origin (typically, this means being cool),
3. Has disadvantages that avoid being annoying,
4. Generally useful when attacked or attacking,
5. About balanced across different stages of progression (early to late game)

I have the powers for each origin organized as:
- The most significant advantage (Most Sig. Adv.),
- The second most significant advantage (Less Sig. Adv.),
- The most significant drawback (Most Sig. Draw.),
- The second most significant drawback (Less Sig. Draw.),
- Other powers (Extra)

I'm hoping this design philosophy, alongside well-polished code, should make very good origins!
